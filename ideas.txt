# DEPTH of FIELD
final update

- small open world, X number (24?) of things to take pictures of and X total exposures
   - idea being it is possible (but hard) to clear things in one go
- each item has a score category (1, 3, 5, 10) that adds score * photo score to your total score
   - only goes up once per item, cant spam same item
- items aren't revealed, but you get a hint when you take photos of one
- once u run out of exposures, you develop and get
   - overall score
   - look at photos
   - time completed
   - completion log (out of X items, blank out not got items)

- takes place in ethereal room/house maybe?
